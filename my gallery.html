<blockquote><font size="3.5">Thank God that I am still alive and well today, and I look forward to making many more memories with the people I care about in the future. 
The image above top depicts the spm result photo I took in 2020. The image below shows me in high school before I was able to shed weight. Being able to achieve both 
successes with my zam and strength makes it my most prized memory to date. I'm hoping that after this, my efforts, willpower, and dedication would lead to numerous victories.
We must always make good memories with the people we love in this brief life. this is due to the short lifespan of many things in this planet. We shall undoubtedly depart one day for good. Make as many memories as you can beforehand in many methods, such as through videos, images, voice recordings, and so on. 
Everything will remain among our most priceless memories that we will always cherish.</blockquote>></font>
